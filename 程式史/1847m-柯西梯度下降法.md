Gradient descent is generally attributed to Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who first suggested it in 1847.[2] Jacques Hadamard independently proposed a similar method in 1907.[3][4] Its convergence properties for non-linear optimization problems were first studied by Haskell Curry in 1944,[5] with the method becoming increasingly well-studied and used in the following decades.[6][7]
